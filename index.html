            Vishal was head hunted by to help me on this complex transformation task of rebuilding a high street bank’s commercial banking
            portal. The qualities that stood out for Vishal were – Passion for excellence Self-drive Technical prowess on
            ReactJS and front end stack. Ability to think both from an engineer’s and customer point-of-view . Over the period
            of last 8 months, so of the key things Vishal has helped me deliver were - Migration of a monolith commercial
            banking portal to a light weight application build using ReactJS Training and mentoring a team of around 15 engineers
            spread across London, Edinburgh and India As an SME and Lead Engineer for Front end stack – helped build framework/accelerator
            to ensure consistent quality from the team. First of a kind Microfrontend framework, which is planned to replace
            legacy portal framework. Along with his technical excellence, he also impressed me with his attitude both as
            an individual and a team player. He has a great sense of commitment and integrity towards the work he does. His
            active collaboration and innovation helped both myself and the product owner improve on this product. He will
            be great asset to any team. I wish him all the very best for his endeavours.

            Vishal was recruited into our team to support a large banking client to re-write their monolithic application into a number
            of ReactJS/Redux based single page applications. During his time with us Vishal has led on this activity, undertaking
            technical spikes and defining the design, defining software standards, training up three agile teams on ReactJS/Redux,
            creating an “accelerator skeleton code” to drive consistency in implementation across teams, and acting as technical
            authority including code reviews. Vishal brings tonnes of enthusiasm to the team and was great fun to work with.
            We are having to let him go due to financial pressure caused by Corona Virus but I would happily offer him another
            role in the future.
